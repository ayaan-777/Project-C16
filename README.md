# Project-C16
This is a project based on cut your fruits, In this new project, I have to apply what you have learned in the class and create a Fruit Cutting game by adding sound effects to make the game more interesting and increase the velocities of fruits and monsters when the score reaches a certain point.
Below is the tory and I hope you enjoy it!
